# Cocos-Headers-2.2
It turns out that the original I'm now choosing to fork off of is no longer being 
updated or maintained so I decided to take over this branch since there's some newer
crap robtop has injected into some class objects that I feel didn't get addressed 
correctly. This repository should be able to solve some problems with intellisense 
inside of modern VSCode Ides such as CCPoint, however I will be strictly using this 
while reverse engineering. Feel free to update and send me pull requests I love it 
when anyone contributes, wants to contribute or even give me ideas.

Unlike the other branch I plan to make this one generate a `libcocos2d.dll` file and `libcocos2d.lib` file 
as well as attempt to verify compilation with `md5` , `sha1`, `sha256`
this should only be for windows 2.204 & android 2.205

For now feel free to send me C++ files if needed.
