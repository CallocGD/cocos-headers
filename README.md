# Cocos-Headers-2.2
It turns out that the original I'm now choosing to fork off of is no longer being 
updated or maintained so I decided to take over this branch since there's some newer
crap robtop has injected into some class objects that I feel didn't get addressed 
correctly. This repository should be able to solve some problems with intellisense 
inside of modern VSCode Ides such as CCPoint, however I will be strictly using this 
while reverse engineering. Feel free to update and send me pull requests I love it 
when anyone contributes, wants to contribute or even give me ideas.
